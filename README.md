# PRODIGY_CS_02
For my second internship task at Prodigy InfoTech, 
I developed a basic image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. 
Simple mathematical operations were applied to each pixel, 
with users providing an encryption key for both encryption and decryption. 
However, due to its simplicity, while encryption is effective, 
decryption results in some loss of image quality, 
making the restored image different from the original.
